# Learning python the social way

Hello folks, I'm writing my first blog post ever, so bare with me. This is supposed to be a tech blog but this piece won't show any code snippet. Rather I'm going to tell you a story. It's the story about how I learned programming. If you are a complete novice in programming or wondering if you can do it at all, I hope you find it inspiring. In fact it

So why is this called learning 'the social way'? Well, when people think about programmers, they usually imagine a bunch a reclusive geeks stuck in front of their computer. On top of that code has this frightening aspect to it: it looks totally uncrompehensible and can make you worry you will never manage to be a programmer.

That's exactly what I did. Having only php on my radar, I started by going to a Drupal conference in Franckfurt June 2014. I didn't understand I was listening to, but I did understand this: every technology has it's community and . That was enough to get me going. I looked on the web for Wordpress conferences and got lucky: the first german gathering was taking place a few months later.

Wordpress was easier for me to understand, since I had already tinkered with it in my spare time.

Step 2: Watch youtube videos
----------------------------

That's right folks, just watch youtube videos. 


Aside: meta-mearning
--------------------

This is a personnal concept of mine. Basically, meta-learning a is learning stuff about learning stuff. Get it? In practice, it's a 

Step 3: Find your local meetups
-------------------------------

Do you know about [meetup.com](http://meetup.com)?. I didn't, but it's proven to be the most effective learning .
