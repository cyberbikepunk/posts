# Learning python the social way

I'm a bike messenger. But by life has completely changed in the space of nine months. I wrote my first line of python on december 30 2014 and never looked back. In this essay, I'll take you on a personnal journey that lead me from bike punks to computer geeks. 

## It's all about the community

Don't get me wrong. I love my current job. Bike messenging is the best job I've had so far. It keeps me really fit. It's fast, dangerous and funky. But actually, what's best about the job is its community. Bike messengers are a family. Everyone looks after everyone else. I like to compare it to a guild: wherever you go, the local community gives you food and shelter, no questions asked. We meet regularly for local, national, continental and even world championships. These competitions are an excuse to get together and throw week long parties. So, if this is so much fun, why am I trying to become a developer? Well, cause I found another great community: pythonistas!


## Who's afraid of geeks?

When people think about programmers, they usually imagine a bunch a reclusive geeks stuck in front of their computer. While there's some truth in that, it's not a fair picture in my experience. Programmers *are* a community. In fact, I discovered that each language has it's own tribe. This came as a big surprise to me. Naively, I had thought that coders were a undistinguishable mass producing undistinguishable code. 

The reality is completely different. Ruby fans are different from Scala addicts and the JSNode people don't share the same demographics as the Java people. Coders have indeed a strong sense of belonging. They often one another'slanguage choice. Languages and their communities thrive and decline in the way civilizations do. 

So my first piece of advice to beginners would be: pick a community and run with it! 

## Step 1: Choosing your programming language

Easier said than done. There are two major problems. First, when you're a beginner, you have no idea where to start! If you're like me, then the only labguage that's on your radar is php, for the only reason that's it seems to trail a lot of webpages. For lot's of people, Ã­t's a natural starter. Many have moved form WordPress tinkerers to php programmers. But I would'nt recommend that. What I recommend it doing some research on what you would like to do as a coder, what language fits the bill and meet. 

So, open youtube and type So my second piece of advice would be: don't be afraid of geeks! Some may be grumpy but none ever bites. I know, it's quite daunting at first 

I guess the rest of this essay is basically a lthere are many sub-communities  
On top of that code has this frightening aspect to it: it looks totally uncrompehensible and can make you worry you will never manage to be a programmer.

Well, if I manage to do it, you can too. I'm no brighter than anyone around me. And certainly not a genius. But I have one skill that is usefull in any field. I'm social.

And this is the way I naturally learnt programming. 

I had really no clue. In fact, having previously tinkered with WordPress before, I thought __php__ was the only game in town when it came to make websites. In fact, I thought that developers *only* made websites! Well, that's definitely not true. So the first advice I would give to beginners is expand your mind and find out what's out there! 


## Step 2: Meet the community

That's exactly what I did. Having only php on my radar, I started by going to a Drupal conference in Franckfurt June 2014. I didn't understand I was listening to, but I did understand this: every technology has it's community and . That was enough to get me going. I looked on the web for Wordpress conferences and got lucky: the first german gathering was taking place a few months later.

Wordpress was easier for me to understand, since I had already tinkered with it in my spare time.

## Step 2: Go to meetups

I have to say, [meetup.com][meetup] is the best thing since sliced bread. If you'Re like me a year ago, you've never heard of it. Of course, you kinda have to be lucky and live in a city. If that's your case then fill up your agenda with any geeky meetup that remotely matches your interests. I've personnally attended dozens of meetups since january .

Some of them were better than other. In some I felt realy lonely 


## When 

Eventually the moment comes blessed moment when your geek aquaintances become friends and the good stuff follows. You can have casual conversation over a beer and ask a million questions or even hang out with them a listen to conversations. Hang out with them some more and you will soon engulg masses of information simply by osmosis. 

That's right folks, just watch youtube videos. 


## Find a hang-out

A geek hang-out. Ya know, a place where a geeks works. Hunt it down. There's one near you but you don't know it yet. In Berlin there's a few cool places. Of course there's Cbase, the hacker space. A there's CO-UP, a co-working space which seems to attract a lot of developers. So I chose to stick'around there. I 

## Aside: meta-mearning

Meta learning is a concept that I crafted when I realised that learning do not always mean. Meta learning is something we all do naturally without noticing. One definition would be:

> Learning general concept without understand a word of what's actually being said. Learning about learning in a sense.

I did 

## listening to podcasts.

This is a personnal concept of mine. Basically, meta-learning a is learning stuff about learning stuff. Get it? In practice, it's a 

## Going to your first python conference


I was lucky to attend [Europython][europython] in Bilbao this year. It was one of the best experiences I had in a long time. 

## Meeting God

So, 6 months into python programming, I'm in eating my buffet in the lounge area and who do I spot. Guido van Rossum, the creator of python and benevolent dictator for life. I remember going up to him and mumbling a few words that 
probably seemed totally incoherent but he was nice to me even though he probably didn't understand the words I uttered. Anyways, it is a defining moment for all python developers, at least those of my kind, who and
