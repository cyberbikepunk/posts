# Learning python the social way

This post is about the journey that lead me from bike punks to computer geeks and how I fast-tracked my apprenticeship with the help of the community. It's my way of saying thank you. 

Up to now I was a bike messenger. Don't get me wrong. It's a great job. What  I especially like is the sense of belonging it procures. Bike messengers are tight community. They race one another at local [alleycats][alleycats], organize [world championships][cmwc] and generally find great excuses to party together. 

So, before teaching myself *hello world*, I wanted to meet programmers. In retrospect, it was a wise decision.

## Choose your community

I first headed out to a WordPress conference in Hamburg. Frankly, at that stage, WordPress was the only thing on my radar. I was a little nervous but given a warm welcome as a beginner. I broke the ice and discovered programmers were normal people.

Later, I sneaked into [eurucamp][eurucamp] despite not having written one line of ruby. Obviously, the details went right over my head, but I got the general idea. And low and behold, I realized programming was not just about web development! That was a major step forward...

It was time to go to my first local python meeting. The atmosphere was shy and geeky, which I liked. I also liked the drinking session in the pub afterwards. I seized the opportunity to inquire about the language and learned that python had a great collection of scientific libraries. 

That struck a chord. Since I had studied physics at university, it seemed fitting to teach myself a language with a penchant for science. So I did a bit more research and, after a bit of hesitation, made up my mind: I was going learn python. Consequently *hello world* would look roughly like this:

	class User(object):
		def __init__(name)
			self.name = name

		def greet(self):
			print('hello ' + self.name) 

	if __name__ == '__main__':
		user = User('cyberbikepunk')
		user.greet()

Yeah... some aspects of the language were weird at first, especially block indentations and double-underscores. But the aesthetic shock disappeared quickly and I soon came to love python's concise and clear syntax. 

More importantly, by picking a language I had also chosen my community.

## Become a sponge

I did not want to learn in isolation. I wanted to benefit from peer knowledge and start networking right away. So I tried a couple of co-working places in Berlin before I identified one called [co-up][co-up] which was a hub for local developers. I knew it was the right place the minute I walked in. I went there as much as possible in my spare time and soon made friends. That was a turning point. From then on, I started learning by osmosis. Meaning: much faster.

Next I discovered the best thing since sliced bread: [meet-ups][meetup]! My personal favorites are those with little or no formal structure, like the [coding amigos][amigos] and the python learners group at the [Open Tech School][ots]. Whether you seek a solution to a problem, help others fix bugs or spark a conversation on a random code related topic, they're always an enriching experience. 

I also regularly attended the [Python User Group][pub] and the [PyData group][pydata], as well as dozens of other meet-ups on a wide range of topics like [data visualization][viz] or [big data][big-data]. Not all meet-ups were interesting or even relevant, but as a whole, they brushed a fantastic overview of the software industry.

## Learn what you don't understand

Incidentally, I didn't expect to understand everything during meet-ups. Discovering the existence of a concept or a piece of software was good enough in many cases. I coined this process __meta-learning__: learning stuff you don't yet understand (my definition of meta-learning differs from the [official one][meta]).

Meta-learning is indispensable because learning to code is not just about learning to code (that's the easy part). It's about understanding the complex web of software you're stepping into. Meta-learning basically means registering important information whilst leaving the details for later. It's best applied in real life because search engines are not very good at distinguishing what's important from what's not. 

For example, you may come across really a cool looking library whilst surfing the web. It looks really cool, but why would you chose that one over another? Humans can answer that question much better than search engines. As far as meta-learning goes, therefore, one conversation is worth a hundred queries. In contrast, when you're micro-learning (i.e. learning the details), online documentation or StackOverflow is often the way to go. 

## Go to mass (and meet god)

Mass, or [Europython][europython] as it's formally known, was in Bilbao this year. Attending mass had many beneficial side effects for me as a beginner. It was a huge source of meta-information, exposed the multiple ways python is being used in the real-world, brought me up to date with the latest developments and put me in contact with all kinds of python programmers.

Perhaps more importantly, I got a deep sense of what the words *open-source community* meant. It was amazing to see that python, although widely used by corporations all over the world, remained a volunteer based, non-commercial, community endeavor. In that respect, the conference was a tremendous source of inspiration. 

Talking about inspiration, I met god. Unfortunately, I can't prove it. In the heat of the moment, *somehow* I forgot to take a selfie. Then again, I was very nervous. It happened over lunch break. I was happily gobbling up my pinchos at one end of the buffet, when I spotted god, or [Guido][guido] as he's formally known, standing alone at the other end. He looked like a newbie desperate to make friends. I mustered a little courage and walked up. 

What I mumbled to him is still unclear to me and was probably incomprehensible to him. I was suddenly unable to articulate anything remotely coherent. In retrospect, maybe I should have just said *hello world* in python. Before leaving, however, I did thank him for changing my life in an embarrassingly lyrical sort of way. He responded something like *oh thank you that's nice of you*. That was it. But boy did I feel inspired!

## Get away from that computer

I suspect that Guido's gentle character rubs off on the whole community. In a sense it's no surprise that almost everyone I've met has been welcoming and helpful and that I've received so much encouragement along the way. In the end, although I'm a little sad to leave my bike messengers friends, I'm very exited to become part of the python community. So thanks to everyone who helped me get to where I am. And remember: the best way to learn python (or any other programming language for that matter) is to get away from that computer!
