    "Do you have trouble understanding decorators? You're not alone. I've identified a couple of mental hurdles that prevent beginners from completely wrapping their head around decorators, even though they may already be using them. My goal is to break down these hurdles, so that you can write your own decorators and live happily ever after! \n",
    "\n",
    "## Why decorators?\n",
    "\n",
    "Decorators are a really nice way to implement seperation of concerns: the idea that a function should do only one thing. Seperation of concerns produces cleaner code. That's by no means the only use-case for decorators, but it's a major one. I have neither the patience nor the knowledge to describe them all. \n",
    "\n",
    "## A quick example\n",
    "\n",
    "Say you have a function that substracts 2 from its input. On top of that, you wanna write to the log every time the function is called. You could add a line inside your function telling it to write to the log file, but that's breaking the rule that a function should do only one thing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Decorator to the rescue! First write a logger decorator, then apply it to your function, then just call the function like normal... et voila... you have seperation of concerns! The big bonus is that you're free to reuse that decorator as much as you want on other functions. Tada! You also have dry code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, so with python's decorator syntax, what I've just described looks like this:"

    "Obviously, there's a lot more to decorators than what we've covered in this tutorial. But we'll stop here for now. The goal was to overcome a couple of mental blockages people typically have when they first come across the concept. I would like to write more on the subject. The next logical step would be to show how you can make decorators with class instances or even classes themselves. And also how you can decorate not only functions, but classes too. Anyways, that's it for now! Ciao ciao."
