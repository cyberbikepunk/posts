#Hire me!

A while back I was a physicist. Then I ran an start-up. Then I became a bike messenger. Now I wanna be a full time pythonista. My interests are data mining, analysis and visualization. I'm currently looking for cool datasets to play with or a friendly workplace to settle in so I can learn more. Anywhere.

I love to code. Get in touch.
