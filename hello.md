#Hello!

Until recently, I had a great job at [Valk Fleet](http://valkfleet.com) as a Data Engineer. Unfortunately I got fired. Wait... I wasn't the only one. Everyone got fired and the company was closed. Nothing really surprising in the world of start-ups. The bottom line is: I'm currently availble for freelance projects. Here is my [resume](http://registry.jsonresume.org/cyberbikepunk). Get in touch! I love to code.

Loic
