#Hello!

Until recently, I had a great job at [Valk Fleet](http://valkfleet.com) ([Delivery Hero](http://deliveryhero.com)) as a Data Engineer. Unfortunately, the company closed down. Nothing really surprising in the world of start-ups. The bottom line is: I'm currently available for freelance projects. Here is my [resume](http://registry.jsonresume.org/cyberbikepunk). I love to code. Get in touch!

Loic
