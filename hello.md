#Hello!

Until last week, I had a great job at [Valk Fleet](http://valkfleet.com) as a Data Engineer. Unfortunately I got fired. Wait... I wasn't the only one. They fired everybody and closed shop. Nothing really surprising in the world of start-ups. The bottom line is: __I'm currently open for freelance projects__. Here is my [resum√©](http://registry.jsonresume.org/cyberbikepunk). Get in touch! I love to code.
