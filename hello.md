#Hello!

I used to be a physicist. Then I became a bike messenger. Now I'm a python developer. I mostly do back-end development and data science (mining, analysis and visualization). I'm very interested in machine learning and natural language processing. I love to code.

I'm a member of [cogeeks][cogeeks], a cooperative of freelance developers in Berlin. We're always looking for cool projects to work on, individually or collectively. Get in touch!
