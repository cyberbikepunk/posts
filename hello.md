#Hello!

I currently work at (Valk Fleet)[http://valkfleet.com] as a Data Engineer. I do mostly data science (ETL, data analysis and visualization) and back-end development (Google App Engine). In my spare time, I teach myself machine learning and natural language processing. My language of choice is python.
